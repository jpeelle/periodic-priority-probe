# Peelle's Periodic Priority Probe

Adopted from:

Sackett DL (2001) On the determinants of academic success as a
clinician-scientist. Clinical and Investigative Medicine 24:94-100.


I've put together this simple checklist for reviewing priorities. Based on Sackett (2001)'s periodic priority list, I've re-ordered some items to match how I think about things.

Although developed primarily with work/research in mind, this is also probably pretty useful for other parts of life, tooâ€”it might work well to do a separate personal and work priority probe every 6 months.
